## This is the Meda GitHub repository.

MEDA, the Metropolitan Economic Development Organization, is a nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, whose mission is to help BIPOC entrepeneurs succeed. Visit our website at [meda.net](https://www.meda.net) to learn more about us and apply for our services.

This GitHub repository will feature some of the things we're doing in IT to support MEDA's mission. We hope other nonprofit organizations and CDFIs can benefit from our experience.
